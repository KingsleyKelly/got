##Got

Got, or git over time, goes through your current branch and takes a snapshot of any page passed as a parameter. Then it turns it into an animated gif, showing how your page has evolved over time.

To run put it the app folder you want to gif and run 
`ruby gotit.rb` 

Whatever branch you are on will get grabbed and it will be placed in the file animations.gif or you can supply a name as the second parameter.
